                    Matthew Du is currently a second-year <a
                        href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/">
                    Mechanical Engineering</a> student (planning to be) in the
                    Mechatronics and Manufacturing streams currently
                    studying at the University of Toronto, with
                    self-initiated minors in <a
                        href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Computer Science</a> (the
                    one offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science) and
                    <a
                            href="https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/minor-robotics-and-mechatronics-aeminram">Robotics and Mechatronics</a>.

                    Matthew is interested in a wide various different topics and
                    disciplines across Mechanical Engineering and Computer
                    Science, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Manufacturing of Mechatronics Systems </li>
                    <li> Computer Vision/Geometry Processing and Machine
                        Learning </li>
                    <li> Robotics Control & Programming </li>
                    <li> Computational & Theoretical Fluid Mechanics </li>
                    <li> Interactive Robotics & Human Robot Interaction </li>
                    <li> Algorithm Design </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Matthew aspires to become a robotics engineer in the
                    future, working on personal, wearable, and assistive
                    robotics and electronics to be able to help people.
                    Throughout all his experiences working in Robotics, whether
                    that would be in a school clubs or in a research lab,
                    Matthew had always noticed that despite the amount of work
                    and usefulness of the robots that he was building, people
                    are not using them and robots are not being integrated into
                    society. He wants to change that and build robots that
                    people can actually use to make their lives better rather
                    than hearing about how others are using them, whether
                    that would be automating unpleasant or repetitive tasks
                    or accommodating for some disability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some soft skills that Matthew possesses is excellent
                    creativity and innovation, as well as strong leadership
                    and ethical judgement. He is reliable, assertive, and
                    helpful on teams, although he is currently working on how
                    to communicate better and delegate tasks more equally
                    with his team.
                </p>
