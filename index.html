                Matthew Du is currently a second-year <a
                    href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/">
                Mechanical Engineering</a> student studying at the
                University of Toronto, with self-initiated minors in <a
                    href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Computer Science</a> (the
                one offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science) and
                <a
                        href="https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/minor-robotics-and-mechatronics-aeminram">Robotics and Mechatronics</a>.

                Matthew is interested in a wide various different topics and
                disciplines across Mechanical Engineering and Computer
                Science, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Manufacturing of Mechatronics Systems </li>
                <li> Computer Vision/Geometry Processing and Machine
                    Learning </li>
                <li> Robotics Control & Programming </li>
                <li> Thermofluids and Computational & Theoretical Fluid
                    Mechanics </li>
                <li> Interactive Robotics & Human Robot Interaction </li>
                <li> Algorithm Design </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Matthew aspires to become a robotics engineer in the
                future, working on personal, wearable, and assistive
                robotics and electronics to be able to help people.
                Throughout all his experiences working in Robotics, whether
                that would be in a school clubs or in a research lab,
                Matthew had always noticed that despite the amount of work
                and usefulness of the robots that he was building, people
                are not using them and robots are not being integrated into
                society. He wants to change that and build robots that
                people can actually use to make their lives better rather
                than hearing about how others are using them, whether
                that would be automating unpleasant or repetitive tasks
                or accommodating for some disability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some soft skills that Matthew possesses is excellent
                creativity and innovation, as well as strong leadership
                and ethical judgement. He is reliable, assertive, and
                helpful on teams, although he is currently working on how
                to communicate better and delegate tasks more equally
                with his team.
            </p>

            <p class="bottom-three">
                Outside of his curricular activities, Matthew is an avid musical
