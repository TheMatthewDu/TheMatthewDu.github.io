        <p>
            I am currently a second-year <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/">
            Mechanical Engineering</a> student studying at the
            University of Toronto with way too many minors, including a minor in <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/">Computer Science</a> (the one offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto).
        </p>

        <p>
            I am interested in a wide variety of subjects, with particular focus in,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Robotics and Mechatronics</li>
            <li>Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Computer Vision &amp; graphics</li>
            <li>Assistive and Personal Devices</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Particularly, I enjoy working on projects that span across multiple
            disciplines, whether that would be a personal device combining
            elements of computer vision and mechatronics, or the
            study of human factors in human robot interaction</p>

        <p>
            I am also the co-president and co-founder of the newly revived
            Student Branch of the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineers
            (CSME) at the University of Toronto. It is a professional
            development organization designed to help bridge the gap between
            academia and industry for mechanical engineering students at the
            University of Toronto. Since it is relatively new, we are still
            setting things up and building our network. If you are an
            organization that would like to partner with us in hosting events
            to gain access to talented mechanical engineering students at the University of Toronto,
            feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:matthew.du@mail.utoronto.ca">matthew.du@mail.utoronto.ca</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-three">
            Outside school, I am an avid musical performer and
            arranger/composer with various musical groups in the Greater
            Toronto Area. My primary instrument is the Violin, but I am
            also proficient in numerous other instruments, such as Viola,
            Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, and Saxophone, to name a few.
