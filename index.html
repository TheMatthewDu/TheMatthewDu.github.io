                I am currently a second-year <a
                    href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/">
                Mechanical Engineering</a> student studying at the
                University of Toronto, with self-initiated minors in <a
                    href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Computer Science</a> (the
                one offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science) and
                <a
                        href="https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/minor-robotics-and-mechatronics-aeminram">Robotics and Mechatronics</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am interested in a wide variety of topics and disciplines
                across Engineering and Computer Science, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Design and Fabrication of Mechatronics Systems </li>
                <li> Robotics Control &amp; Programming </li>
                <li> Computational &amp; Theoretical Fluid Mechanics </li>
                <li> Computer Vision &amp; Geometry Processing </li>
                <li> Interactive Robotics &amp; Human Robot Interaction </li>
                <lI> Machine Learning </lI>
                <li> Algorithm Design </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I aspire to become a robotics engineer in the future, working
                on personal, wearable, and assistive robotics and electronics
                to help people by automating repetitive tasks. While working
                in research labs and school clubs, I have noticed that,
                despite the labour involved and the overall utility of
                robots, people are not using them and are not integrated into
                society. I want to change that and build robots that people
                can use to enrich their lives, not just hear about how others
                use them on the news.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some soft skills that I possess are excellent creativity and
                innovation, as well as strong leadership and ethical
                judgment. I am known to be reliable, assertive, and highly
                organized in teams, but currently working on how to work
                better and delegate tasks more equally.
            </p>

            <p class="bottom-three">
                Outside school, I am an avid musical performer and
                arranger/composer with various musical groups in the Greater
                Toronto Area. My primary instrument is the Violin, but I am
                also proficient in numerous other instruments, such as Viola,
                Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, and Saxophone, to name a few.
