    <h3>Design and Testing of Vision Algorithms for an Interactive Soft
        Robotic Hand </h3>
    <p>This is the summer research project that I was involved with in the
        summer of 2022 at the <a href="https://liulab.mie.utoronto.ca/">
            Microfluidics and BioMEMS Lab (MBL)</a> at the University of
        Toronto in collaboration with Zhanfeng Zhou and under the
        supervision of Dr Xinyu Liu. I was worked on Computer Vision and
        image segmentation and smoothing algorithms for Soft Robotic Arm.
    </p>
    <p>I presented my findings at the annual University of Toronto
        Undergraduate Engineering Research Day Conference (UnERD). The
        abstract for the submission can be found <a
                href="src/portfolio_files/Abstract%20Template.pdf">here</a>. This
        project was also later presented in an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
        conference with the President Yoon Suk-yeol of the Republic of Korea
        at the University of Toronto in September 2022. More details regarding
        the conference can be found

    <h2>Binary Bot 2.0</h2>
    <p>
        Meet BinaryBot (2.0). It is an autonomous robot created using Lego
        Mindstorms EV3 that I designed and programmed myself. It reads black and
        white lines as 1s and 0s respectively, and converts and writes it in
        Base 10 (Decimal). In the following video, it demonstrates two samples
        of BinaryBot in action.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 2.0 at the end of its name is a nod to a previous version of the same
        robot I had made many years ago with a fellow partner using the Lego
        Mindstorms NXT set. Unfortunately, the footage of that robot has since
        been lost.
